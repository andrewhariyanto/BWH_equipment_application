# BWH_equipment_application
Eleven-person team working to apply Agile Scrum development methodologies and software design patterns in Java to create a medical equipment tracking and workflow application that included a hospital dashboard, floor map editor, and multiple integrated service request modules for Brigham &amp; Womenâ€™s Hospital. The software system that the team created served to inform hospital representatives about potential features, user interfaces, or design approaches that they might consider implementing.
